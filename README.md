Introduction
For this project, I focused on comparing the environmental impact of two oil and gas refineries in Liaoning Province, China: the Shenyang PARAFFIN-WAX Chemical Refinery and the Tieling Refinery. Both are significant players in the region’s energy sector, but like most industrial facilities, they contribute to environmental issues, primarily through emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O. My goal was to analyze their emissions data, identify trends, and understand how these refineries compare in terms of environmental performance.

I pulled emissions data from an API and cleaned it to extract the most relevant information. Then, I calculated key metrics like CO2 emissions per barrel of oil refined to get a clearer sense of the operational efficiency and environmental impact at each facility. The results showed that while both refineries contribute to local and global emissions, Tieling consistently reported higher emissions overall, as well as per barrel, compared to Shenyang. This suggests there may be differences in refinery operations, technology, or fuel usage between the two.

To make these differences more understandable, I used visualizations such as line and bar charts, which made it easier to spot trends over time. The data revealed that Shenyang has been relatively effective at reducing emissions over the years, likely due to improvements in technology or more efficient processes. On the other hand, Tieling’s emissions remain higher, which could be a sign that the refinery may benefit from more advanced emissions-reduction strategies, like carbon capture or better process optimization.

I also built a simple linear regression model to predict how CO2 emissions might change with variations in refinery activity and capacity utilization. The model showed a strong correlation between increased capacity and higher emissions, which reinforces the idea that reducing refinery output, without sacrificing efficiency, could be an effective strategy for minimizing emissions.

In conclusion, this analysis sheds light on the environmental performance of two key refineries in China. It shows that even small changes in operations can have a significant impact on emissions, and it highlights the importance of adopting more sustainable practices in the energy industry to help reduce the global carbon footprint.
